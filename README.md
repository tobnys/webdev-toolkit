# Goal & Use Case

The goal of the application was (outside of learning) to simply bring a collection of frequently used tools for a web developer, such as lorem ipsum generation, cheat sheets and popular/common fonts for the web. I wanted to combine these "functions" into one single application that would be easily accessible on the web and easily used.

## API Documentation
### GET endpoint - ../api/functional/fonts/:sort
Retrieves fonts from the google web fonts API based on sort parameter.

### GET endpoint - ../api/functional/text
Generates and returns a text with a set amount of paragraphs based on a query option sent to the server. This endpoint uses the package called "loremIpsum" to generate the paragraphs.

### GET endpoint - ../api/functional/statistics
Retrieves statistics from a database which contains information about the application in general, for example, total amount of API calls. This is used in the application to show fun facts about the application.
